- Title: Mentorship
  Content: !markdown |
    Here at FOSS@Amrita, seniors guide juniors on their way in the club. It is a learning and development
    partnership between someone with vast experience and someone who wants to learn. Mentoring others is one
    of the most important parts of being in a community. This is an experience and a skill which cannot be
    gained in a classroom. In FOSS@Amrita when you get enough experience, you will be assigned mentees -
    people whom you have to train. You will be responsible for tracking their progress, ensuring that they
    are doing what is best suited for them.
